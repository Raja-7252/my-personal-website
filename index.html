            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Raja Kalyanapu, a Master's student specializing in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a deep-rooted interest in the burgeoning field of Data Analytics. My academic journey is uniquely enriched by a cross-disciplinary approach, encompassing key subjects like Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Nueral Networks.

With a proactive mindset to broaden my expertise, I have ventured into Computer Science courses, gaining proficiency in Database Management. This diverse educational experience has equipped me with a robust set of technical skills including Python, SQL, Power BI, HTML, and CSS. These tools are the bedrock upon which I analyze and interpret complex datasets, turning data into actionable insights.

My passion for this field is further exemplified through various hands-on projects. Notable among these is my work on Predictive Modeling for Data Classification, a project that underscores my ability to harness machine learning algorithms to sift through and categorize data efficiently. Another exciting venture is the Emotion Detection in Faces, where I delved into the nuances of human emotion recognition using advanced computational techniques. Additionally, my project on Predictive Pest Management for Sustainable Agriculture showcases my commitment to applying data analytics for societal and environmental good, highlighting a blend of technical acumen and social responsibility.

These projects have not only honed my technical skills but also nurtured my analytical thinking, problem-solving capabilities, and a keen eye for detail. As I continue my academic journey, I am enthusiastic about exploring further opportunities in data analytics and machine learning, seeking internships, and engaging in collaborative research that aligns with my interests.

I am eager to connect with professionals and peers who share my passion for technology and innovation. Feel free to reach out to discuss ideas, opportunities, or simply to exchange knowledge in this exciting field of Electrical and Computer Engineering, particularly in the realm of data analytics.

        <h3>Emotion Detection in Faces</h3>
        <p>A deep neural network model was built to detect emotions in faces using a dataset of grayscale images. Through
experimentation with hyperparameters, a validation accuracy of at least 60% was achieved. The model's performance was evaluated using the test dataset, and the Confusion Matrix and Classification Report were generated to assess its effectiveness.The technologies used in this project included Python, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Tensor Board.
